# Fonts (matching your posters)

To match your poster fonts perfectly, we need the exact font files.

## Where to put the font files

Put your font files here:
- `apps/web/public/fonts/`

Recommended format:
- `.woff2` (best performance + modern browsers)

## What to send me

Reply with:
- The exact filenames you placed in `apps/web/public/fonts/`
- Confirmation you have permission/licensing to use them in a web app

Then I’ll wire them into `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` using `@font-face` and update the app typography to match your branding.
